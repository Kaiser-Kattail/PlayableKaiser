 START_SCREEN_PKI_PRESET: "Ever since the Katzen race first appeared on the surface of Flusion, we have grown only stronger as a species. Our true origin is shrouded in mystery, with several biohistorians and theorists claiming that the difference in genetic structure between Katzens and other Flusionian species can only be explained with our being of a different planet. While this is not an impossible theory, it is, overall, irrelevant to our history. Our expansion across what is now the Katzen Herzlands, as well as the growth of our political power internationally, has been incredible.\n\nDuring the course of the Wacegi War, the use of nuclear weaponry by our forces was instrumental in bringing out a swift end to the conflict. However, after the end of the war, the international community has begun scorning us for such bombardment, especially our Roqualian rivals. Factions within our government endlessly argue over the morality of our actions, and political turmoil has brought us almost to the point of civil war.\n\nRecently, however, an individual has appeared within our political system, and begun maneuvering his way into higher positions. And so, the balance of power within the Kingdom begins to shift..." #NT!

Alongside these bases are numerous shipments of both skilled personnel and excavation equipment being brought to Muno, which shall work tirelessly during the coming decades in order to bring the Kaiser's vision to reality. \n\nWhile Flusion's other nations have expressed concerns at this endeavor, Kaiser Kattail has personally reassured them that this project is, and will remain a defensive weapon meant to protect all of Flusion, and that worries of it being turned against Flusion itself are unfounded, even offering Flusion's leading powers to participate in the project as a show of goodwill." #NT!
